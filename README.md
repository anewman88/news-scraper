Assignment 14 - All the News That's Fit to Scrape

## Overview Description
Homework Assignment 14 - All the News That's Fit to Scrape
SMU Programming Bootcamp Spring 2019

### Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to create a web app that scrapes news stories from a news outlet and lets users view, save articles, and leave comments (on the saved articles) for the scraped news articles.  For this project I scraped the NASA JPL CIT news website https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/.  The app uses Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape the news articles from the NASA JPL site.

My working app can be found on Heroku [here](https://warm-earth-75204.herokuapp.com/)

### Node Packages Used
The following packages are needed (npm install 'pkg name') to run the app

   * [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)

   * [Express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)

   * [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)

   * [Cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio)
   
   * [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

## Instructions for Running the App 

There are two ways to start/run the app.

### Running the app on your computer from Heroku
